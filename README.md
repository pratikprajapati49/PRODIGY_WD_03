# Tic Tac Toe Web Application

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns placing their respective symbols (X or O) on the board. The objective is to get three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before their opponent.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file that represents the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the game board and user interface elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic and user interactions.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will start with Player X's turn.
3. Click on an empty cell on the game board to place your symbol (X or O).
4. Players take turns placing their symbols on the board.
5. The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when the board is full and no player has won (a tie).
6. The game will display the winner or announce a tie.
7. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
